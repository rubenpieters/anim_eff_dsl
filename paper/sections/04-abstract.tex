This paper presents \dsl{}, an extensible and inspectable DSL embedded in Haskell for expressing micro-animations. The philosophy of \dsl{} is to compose animations based on sequential and parallel composition of smaller animations. This is different from other animation libraries which focus more on sequential composition and have only limited forms of parallel composition. To provide similar flexibility as other animation libraries, \dsl{} features extensibility of operations and inspectability of animations.
We present the features of \dsl{} with a to-do list application use case, give an insight into the implementation of \dsl{}, and argue that the callback style of extensibility is detrimental for correctly combining the features in \dsl{}. We give some examples expressed with the GreenSock Animation Platform, a professional-grade and widely used JavaScript animation library, to illustrate this point.
