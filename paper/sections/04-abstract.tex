This paper presents \dsl{}, an extensible and inspectable DSL embedded in Haskell for expressing micro-animations. The philosophy of \dsl{} is to compose animations based on sequential and parallel composition of smaller animations. This is different from other animation libraries which focus more on sequential composition and have a limited form of parallel composition. To provide similar flexibility as other animation libraries, \dsl{} features extensibility of operations and inspectability of animations.
We present the features of \dsl{} with a todo-list application use case, give an insight into the implementation of \dsl{}, and argue for the addition of parallel composition as a basic element to other animation libraries, for which we take GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) as a representative example.
