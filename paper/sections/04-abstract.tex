This paper presents \dsl{}, an extensible and inspectable DSL embedded in Haskell for expressing micro-animations. The philosophy of \dsl{} is to compose animations based on sequential and parallel composition of smaller animations. This differs from other animation libraries that focus more on sequential composition and have only limited forms of parallel composition. To provide similar flexibility to other animation libraries, \dsl{} features extensibility of operations and inspectability of animations.
We present the features of \dsl{} with a to-do list application, discuss the \dsl{} implementation, and argue that the callback style of extensibility is detrimental for correctly combining \dsl{} features. To illustrate this, we contrast with the GreenSock Animation Platform, a professional-grade and widely used JavaScript animation library.
