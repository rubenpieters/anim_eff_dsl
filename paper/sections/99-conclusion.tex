\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented \dsl{}, an extensible and inspectable DSL for micro-animations. \dsl{} focuses heavily on both sequential and parallel composition of animations. This is in contrast with other animation libraries which are mostly focused on sequential composition and only provide a limited form of parallel composition.

We explained the features of \dsl{} with the help of a todo-list application use case. In this use case we showed the use of the additional features of \dsl{}: extensiblity, inspectability and expressivity. We argue that parallel composition is a basic element of animations which should be taken into account to correctly support the combination of these features.
