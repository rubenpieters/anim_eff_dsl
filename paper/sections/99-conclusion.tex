\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented \dsl{}, an extensible and inspectable DSL for micro-animations. \dsl{} focuses on compositional animations using sequential and parallel animations as basic building blocks. This is in contrast with other animation libraries typically focused on sequential composition and callbacks with implicit effects.

We utilized a to-do list application use case to explain the features of \dsl{}. In this use case we showed the additional features of \dsl{}: extensiblity, inspectability and expressivity. We argue that the callback style of providing extensibility hurts the inspectability aspect of animations, which is found in for example the GreenSock Animation Platform. An implementation of the Pac-Man game confirms that this can be a problem even in simple applications.
