\section{Extensibility, Inspectability and Expressiveness}
\label{sec:features}

The features seen in Section~\ref{sec:motivation} form the basis of \dsl{}.
However, animation libraries such as GSAP provide a much more extensive list of
features.

To add support for similar features, we design \dsl{} with extensibility and
inspectability in mind. This means that \dsl{} can be extended with custom
operations and information can be derived from inspecting specified animations.
To support arbitrary expressiveness in combination with those
features, we also emphasize the possibility to extend \dsl{} with custom
combinators.

\subsection{Extensibility}
\label{sec:customop}

The \hs{linearTo} operation and the \hs{sequential} and \hs{parallel} combinators form the basis for expressing a variety of animations. However, there are different situations which require different primitives to express our desired animation. For example, GSAP provides a primitive to morph one shape into another.

An example in the to-do list app is the \hs{checkIcon} animation, part of the \hs{markAsDone} animation, where we want to set the color of the checkmark to a new value. We define a custom \hs{set} operation and embed it inside a \dsl{} animation. In this animation we use Haskell's \hs{do}-notation to specify sequential animations.

\begin{spec}
checkIcon = do ...; set (checkmark . color) green; ...
\end{spec}

%\begin{figure}[h]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=\figscale\textwidth]{pictures/todo}
%\caption{The \hs{checkIcon} animation.}
%\label{fig:}
%\end{figure}

\subsection{Inspectability}

\dsl{} is inspectable, meaning that we can derive properties of expressed computations by \emph{inspecting them rather than running them}. For example, if we want to know the duration of \hs{menuIntro} without actually running it and keeping track of the time. We can do this by using a predefined \hs{duration} function, which calculates the duration by inspecting the animation. This gives a duration of \hs{0.5} seconds, which is indeed the duration of two \hs{0.5} second animations in parallel.

\begin{spec}
menuIntroDuration = duration menuIntro -- = 0.5
\end{spec}

Of course, it is not possible to inspect every animation. In the following situation we have a custom operation \hs{get}, the dual of \hs{set} in the previous section, returning a \hs{Float}. If the result of this value is used as the duration parameter of an animation, then we cannot know upfront how long this animation will last. Requesting to calculate the duration of such an animation results in a type error.

\begin{spec}
complicatedAnim = do v <- get; linearTo lens (For v) (To 10)
complicatedAnimDuration = duration complicatedAnim -- type error
\end{spec}

Calculating a duration is mostly a stepping stone towards supporting other interesting features. One such example is sequentially composing animations with a relative offset. For example, to compose a first animation \hs{anim1} with a second animation \hs{anim2} which starts 0.5 seconds before the end of \hs{anim1}.

\begin{spec}
relSeqAnim = relSequential anim1 anim2 (-0.5)
\end{spec}

\subsection{Expressiveness}
\label{sec:customcomb}

Similarly to providing custom operations, \dsl{} also supports custom
combinators. For typical monadic DSLs this is not needed as \hs{>>=} and \hs{return} 
cover all use cases.
However, since \dsl{} has the additional requirement of being inspectable, the
\hs{>>=} combinator ends up being a liability because it only provides a very
limited amount of inspectability.

In the \hs{onlyDone} animation, we show all \emph{done} items, while
hiding all \emph{to-do} items. This could be implemented by first
showing all items with the \hs{showAll} animation, since an item might have
been hidden by a previous action, and then hiding all to-do items with the
\hs{hideToDo} animation. The definition for this is given below, while the
implementation of \hs{showAll} and \hs{hideToDo} is omitted.

\begin{spec}
onlyDoneNaive = do showAll; hideToDo
\end{spec}

However, this animation is a bit naive since it executes the \hs{showAll}
animation regardless of whether there are any hidden done items that actually
need to appear. Instead, the intended animation is to only make done items
appear when any were hidden. This is done by first checking whether there are
any done items and based on that we play the naive version of \hs{onlyDone},
otherwise we just hide the not done items.

\begin{spec}
onlyDone = do
  cond <- doneItemsGt0    -- check if more than 0 'done' items
  if cond then onlyDoneNaive else hideToDo
\end{spec}

However, if we also want to inspect this computation, this formulation
is problematic since it is specified using a construction which is too general;
we explain this in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:interaction}. Instead, we
can define a custom combinator \hs{ifThenElse} to express \hs{onlyDone}
in an inspectable manner.

\begin{spec}
onlyDone = ifThenElse doneItemsGt0 onlyDoneNaive hideToDo
\end{spec}

For this new combinator, we can define custom ways to inspect it. Since each
branch might have a different duration, we do not choose to extract the
duration but rather the \emph{maximum} duration of the animation.

\begin{spec}
onlyDoneMaxDuration = maxDuration onlyDone -- = 1
\end{spec}

Sections~\ref{sec:motivation} and \ref{sec:features} gave a look and feel of the
features of \dsl{}. In the following sections, we delve deeper into the
internals of the implementation.
