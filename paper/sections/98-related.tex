\subsection{Functional Reactive Programming}
The origins of functional reactive programming lie in the creation of animations \cite{DBLP:conf/icfp/ElliottH97}. Since then, many developments have been based on this idea to create purely functional GUIs. It is a natural question to ask how this work relates to the idea of functional programming, since there seems to be some common ground.

This DSL is intended to be usable on top of an underlying framework such as functional reactive programming, rather than instead of it. We believe that the essence of the dsl: \hs{basic}, \hs{par}, and \hs{seq} can be translated into functional reactive programming primitives. This can help in expressing animations on a higher level, if so desired.

The flexibility of the DSL enables it to be used on top of other frameworks as well, such as immediate mode GUIs or traditional event-based GUIs.
