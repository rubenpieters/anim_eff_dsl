This paper presents \dsl{}, an extensible and inspectable DSL embedded in Haskell for expressing micro-animations. \dsl{} builds animations in compositional fashion, using parallel and sequential animations as basic building blocks. This differs from typical animation libraries which mostly focus on sequential composition and utilize callbacks and implicit effects for their expressivity. To provide similar flexibility to other animation libraries, \dsl{} features extensibility of operations and inspectability of animations.
We present the features of \dsl{} with a to-do list application, discuss the \dsl{} implementation, and argue that the callback style of extensibility is detrimental for correctly integrating inspectability. To illustrate this, we contrast with the GreenSock Animation Platform, a professional-grade and widely used JavaScript animation library.
